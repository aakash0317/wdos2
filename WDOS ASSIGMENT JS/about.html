        <h2>A few words about Turtles</h2>

        <p class="p2">Turtles are an order of reptiles known as Testudines, characterized by a special shell developed
            mainly from their ribs. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the Pleurodira (side necked
            turtles) and Cryptodira (hidden necked turtles), which differ in the way the head retracts. There are 360
            living and recently extinct species of turtles, including land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins.
            They are found on most continents, some islands and, in the case of sea turtles, much of the ocean. Like
            other amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals) they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many
            species live in or around water.
            Turtle shells are made mostly of bone; the upper part is the domed carapace, while the underside is the
            flatter plastron or belly-plate. Its outer surface is covered in scales made of keratin, the material of
            hair, horns, and claws. The carapace bones develop from ribs that grow sideways and develop into broad flat
            plates that join up to cover the body. Turtles are ectotherms or "cold-blooded", meaning that their internal
            temperature varies with their direct environment. They are generally opportunistic omnivores and mainly feed
            on plants and animals with limited movements. Many turtles migrate short distances seasonally. Sea turtles
            are the only reptiles that migrate long distances to lay their eggs on a favored beach.
            Turtles have appeared in myths and folktales around the world. Some terrestrial and freshwater species are
            widely kept as pets. Turtles have been hunted for their meat, for use in traditional medicine, and for their
            shells. Sea turtles are often killed accidentally as bycatch in fishing nets. Turtle habitats around the
            world are being destroyed. As a result of these pressures, many species are extinct or threatened with
            extinction.</p>

        <h3>Size</h3>

        <p class="p3">The largest living species of turtle (and fourth-largest reptile) is the leatherback turtle, which
            can reach over 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) in length and weigh over 500 kg (1,100 lb). The largest known turtle was
            Archelon ischyros, a Late Cretaceous sea turtle up to 4.5 m (15 ft) long, 5.25 m (17 ft) wide between the
            tips of the front flippers, and estimated to have weighed over 2,200 kg (4,900 lb).The smallest living
            turtle is Chersobius signatus of South Africa, measuring no more than 10 cm (3.9 in) in length and weighing
            172 g (6.1 oz).</p>

        <h3>Shell</h3>

        <p class="p4">The shell of a turtle is unique among vertebrates and serves to protect the animal and provide
            shelter from the elements. It is primarily made of 50â€“60 bones and consists of two parts: the domed, dorsal
            (back) carapace and the flatter, ventral (belly) plastron. They are connected by lateral (side) extensions
            of the plastron.
            The carapace is fused with the vertebrae and ribs while the plastron is formed from bones of the shoulder
            girdle, sternum, and gastralia (abdominal ribs). During development, the ribs grow sideways into a
            carapacial ridge, unique to turtles, entering the dermis (inner skin) of the back to support the carapace.
            The development is signaled locally by proteins known as fibroblast growth factors that include FGF10. The
            shoulder girdle in turtles is made up of two bones, the scapula and the coracoid. Both the shoulder and
            pelvic girdles of turtles are located within the shell and hence are effectively within the rib cage. The
            trunk ribs grow over the shoulder girdle during development.

            Development of the shell. The ribs are growing sideways into the carapacial ridge, seen here as a bud, to
            support the carapace. The shell is covered in epidermal (outer skin) scales known as scutes that are made of
            keratin, the same substance that makes up hair and fingernails. Typically, a turtle has 38 scutes on the
            carapace and 16 on the plastron, giving them 54 in total. Carapace scutes are divided into "marginals"
            around the margin and "vertebrals" over the vertebral column, though the scute that overlays the neck is
            called the "cervical". "Pleurals" are present between the marginals and vertebrals. Plastron scutes include
            gulars (throat), humerals, pectorals, abdominals, and anals. Side-necked turtles additionally have
            "intergular" scutes between the gulars. Turtle scutes are usually structured like mosaic tiles, but some
            species, like the hawksbill sea turtle, have overlapping scutes on the carapace.</p>
