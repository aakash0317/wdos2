        <h3>Loggerhead sea Turtles</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>Scientific name: Caretta caretta</li>
            <li>Suborder: Cryptodira</li>
            <li>Family: Cheloniidae</li>
            <li>Where found: Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea</li>
            <li>Kingdom: Animalia</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="p2">The loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) is a species of oceanic turtle distributed throughout
            the world. It is a marine reptile, belonging to the family Cheloniidae. The average loggerhead measures
            around 90 cm (35 in) in carapace length when fully grown. The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs
            approximately 135 kg (298 lb), with the largest specimens weighing in at more than 450 kg (1,000 lb). The
            skin ranges from yellow to brown in color, and the shell is typically reddish brown. No external differences
            in sex are seen until the turtle becomes an adult, the most obvious difference being the adult males have
            thicker tails and shorter plastrons (lower shells) than the females.

            The loggerhead sea turtle is found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean
            Sea. It spends most of its life in saltwater and estuarine habitats, with females briefly coming ashore to
            lay eggs. The loggerhead sea turtle has a low reproductive rate; females lay an average of four egg clutches
            and then become quiescent, producing no eggs for two to three years. The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity
            within 17–33 years and has a lifespan of 47–67 years.

            The loggerhead sea turtle is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Its large and
            powerful jaws serve as an effective tool for dismantling its prey. Young loggerheads are exploited by
            numerous predators; the eggs are especially vulnerable to terrestrial organisms. Once the turtles reach
            adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals, such as large sharks.</p2>

        <h3>Hawksbill sea Turtles</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li> Scientific name: Eretmochelys imbricata</li>
            <li> Suborder: Cryptodira</li>
            <li> Family: Cheloniidae</li>
            <li> Where found: tropical reefs of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans</li>
            <li>Kingdom: Animalia</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="p2">The hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a critically endangered sea turtle belonging
            to the family Cheloniidae. It is the only extant species in the genus Eretmochelys. The species has a global
            distribution, that is largely limited to tropical and subtropical marine and estuary ecosystems.

            The hawksbill's appearance is similar to that of other marine turtles. In general, it has a flattened body
            shape, a protective carapace, and flipper-like limbs, adapted for swimming in the open ocean. E. imbricata
            is easily distinguished from other sea turtles by its sharp, curving beak with prominent tomium, and the
            saw-like appearance of its shell margins. Hawksbill shells slightly change colors, depending on water
            temperature. While this turtle lives part of its life in the open ocean, it spends more time in shallow
            lagoons and coral reefs. The World Conservation Union, primarily as a result of human fishing practices,
            classifies E. imbricata as critically endangered.[3] Hawksbill shells were the primary source of
            tortoiseshell material used for decorative purposes. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered
            Species (CITES) regulates the international trade of hawksbill sea turtles and products derived from
            them.[4]
            Adult hawksbill sea turtles typically grow to 1 m (3 ft) in length, weighing around 80 kg (180 lb) on
            average. The heaviest hawksbill ever captured weighed 127 kg (280 lb).[9] The turtle's shell, or carapace,
            has an amber background patterned with an irregular combination of light and dark streaks, with
            predominantly black and mottled-brown colors radiating to the sides.[10]
            Hawksbill sea turtles have a wide range, found predominantly in tropical reefs of the Indian, Pacific, and
            Atlantic Oceans. Of all the sea turtle species, E. imbricata is the one most associated with warm tropical
            waters. Two significant subpopulations are known, in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific.[18]</p2>

            <li>Conservation status: Near threatened</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="p2">The red-eared slider or red-eared terrapin (Trachemys scripta elegans) is a subspecies of the pond
            slider (Trachemys scripta), a semiaquatic turtle belonging to the family Emydidae. It is the most popular
            pet turtle in the United States, is also popular as a pet across the rest of the world, and is the most
            invasive turtle.[2] It is the most commonly traded turtle in the world.[3][4]

            The red-eared slider is native from the Midwestern United States to northern Mexico, but has become
            established in other places because of pet releases, and has become invasive in many areas where it
            outcompetes native species. The red-eared slider is included in the list of the world's 100 most invasive
            species.[6]</p>

        <h3>Green Sea Turtles</h3>

            <li> Scientific name: Chelonia mydas</li>
            <li>Suborder: Cryptodira (hidden-neck turtles)</li>
            <li>Family: Cheloniidae</li>

            <li>Conservation status: Endangered</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="p2">Reaching a weight of 200 kg / 440 lb., the green sea turtle is the largest hard-shelled sea
            turtle; only the leatherback sea turtle, which has a leathery carapace, is larger.

            The green sea turtle gets its name, not because of its carapace color (which is a dark olive), but because
            of the green fat found under it.

            It takes green sea turtles from 20 to 50 years to reach sexual maturity. Females return to the same beach on
            which they were born to lay their clutches. Very few hatchlings survive past their first year; according to
            several studies it is estimated that only 1 out of every 1000 make it to adulthood.

            Green sea turtles are omnivores as juveniles, but after reaching a certain size their diet becomes almost
            entirely herbivorous.

            This species is very social and usually moves in large groups that can swim as far as 90 km / 55.9 miles in
            a day.</p>

        <h3>Leatherback Turtles</h3>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li> Scientific name: Dermochelys coriacea</li>
            <li>Suborder: Cryptodira</li>
            <li>Family: Dermochelyidae</li>
            <li>Where found: Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and western Pacific Oceans</li>
            <li>Conservation status: Endangered</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="p2">The leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), sometimes called the lute turtle or leathery
            turtle or simply the luth, is the largest of all living turtles and the heaviest non-crocodilian reptile,
            reaching lengths of up to 1.8 metres (5 ft 11 in) and weights of 500 kilograms (1,100 lb).[5][6] It is the
            only living species in the genus Dermochelys and family Dermochelyidae. It can easily be differentiated from
            other modern sea turtles by its lack of a bony shell; instead, its carapace is covered by oily flesh and
            flexible, leather-like skin, for which it is named.The leatherback turtle is a species with a cosmopolitan
            global range. Of all the extant sea turtle species, D. coriacea has the widest distribution, reaching as far
            north as Alaska and Norway and as far south as Cape Agulhas in Africa and the southernmost tip of New
            Zealand.[20] The leatherback is found in all tropical and subtropical oceans, and its range extends well
            into the Arctic Circle.[45]

            The three major, genetically distinct populations occur in the Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and western
            Pacific Oceans.[5][46] While nesting beaches have been identified in the region, leatherback populations in
            the Indian Ocean remain generally unassessed and unevaluated.[47]

            Recent estimates of global nesting populations are that 26,000 to 43,000 females nest annually, which is a
            dramatic decline from the 115,000 estimated in 1980.</p>
