        <h2>Threats for sea turtles</h2>

        <p class="p2">Threats to sea turtles are numerous and have caused many sea turtle species to be endangered. Of
            the seven extant species of sea turtles, six in the family Cheloniidae and one in the family Dermochelyidae,
            all are listed on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. The list classifies six species of sea turtle as
            "threatened", two of them as "critically endangered", one as "endangered" and three as "vulnerable". The
            flatback sea turtle is classified as "data deficient" which means that there is insufficient information
            available for a proper assessment of conservation status.[1] Although sea turtles usually lay around one
            hundred eggs at a time, on average only one of the eggs from the nest will survive to adulthood.[2] While
            many of the things that endanger these hatchlings are natural, such as predators including sharks, raccoons,
            foxes, and seagulls,[3] many new threats to the sea turtle species are anthropogenic.[4]</p>

        <h3>Artificial Lightning</h3>
        <p class="p2">Artificial lighting is a threat to adult and hatchling sea turtles. Sea turtles use the brightest
            horizon as a guide to the ocean. This was created by celestial lights reflecting off the oceanâ€™s surface.
            With human development along the coast, artificial light sources are growing in abundance. Unfortunately,
            these human-made lights are brighter than celestial lights, causing sea turtles to move toward them. A sea
            turtle not going in the direction of the ocean is referred to as a disorientation event. Disorientations
            lead to an increased risk of predation, exhaustion, dehydration, and/or injury. These events are often
            fatal. Disorientations can be caused by any light source that is directly or indirectly seen from the beach.
            Also, heavily lit beaches may cause an adult to have a false crawl. This is when the female decides the
            beach is not suitable for her nest and goes back to the water. False crawls cause exhaustion for the adult
            and may lead to her releasing her eggs in the ocean. This would be fatal to all the eggs.

            As awareness of the negative impact artificial lighting has on sea turtles has grown, there have been
            several large-scale conservation efforts by Marine Life programs and conservation groups to educate the
            public on turtle conservation. Communities situated on or near a beach have been warned of the effects
            excessive lighting has on sea turtles and there have been substantial attempts to darken beaches and replace
            harmful artificial lighting with turtle-safe lights. Coastal communities have also been creating and
            updating their lighting ordinances with the common goal to help save sea turtles. Lighting ordinances allow
            local governments to enforce safer lighting for sea turtles.</p>

        <h3>Ocean Plastic</h3>
        <p class="p2">Eight million tons of plastic make their way to the ocean every year.[11] For many marine species,
            including sea turtles, plastics in our oceans can lead to threats of entanglement, habitat degradation, and
            ingestion.[12] Discarded plastic bags floating in the ocean resemble jellyfish, a common food of sea
            turtles. If a turtle eats a plastic bag, it tends to clog the turtle's digestive system and result in the
            animal dying. There have been many cases of dissection showing plastic and other debris inside turtles'
            stomachs and intestines.[13] Marine debris has caused mortality in all species of sea turtles. [14]There
            have also been cases where sea turtles have been found with plastic straws in their noses, plastic bags or
            toothbrushes in their stomachs, or fish hooks stuck on their flippers.[15] Plastic straws can be dangerous
            to sea turtles, too, because they are often mistaken for food.[16] This can cause the sea turtle to choke or
            die of starvation because they feel full and do not eat, when they are actually full of plastic.[16] Despite
            being small, plastic straws are among the top items that pollute the ocean.[17] As previously mentioned,
            ingestion is also more likely to occur if the plastic resembles their typical food. Studies have found that
            turtles had a 50% chance of dying if they ingested more than fourteen pieces of plastic[18]</p>

        <h3>Oil spills and marine pollution</h3>
        <p class="p2">Marine pollution is both directly harmful to sea turtles as well as indirectly, through the
            deterioration of their natural habitats. Some of the most dangerous ocean pollutants include toxic metals,
            PCBs, fertilizers, untreated waste, chemicals, and a variety of petroleum products. Oil spills are
            particularly dangerous to sea turtles.[6] Although oil does not tend to stick to them as it does to other
            marine life, sea turtles are still at risk when they surface for air, where oil can get in their eyes, skin,
            and lungs, which can lead to significant health problems. Even if they are not directly in contact with
            marine pollution, sea turtles can still ingest harmful chemicals through the food they eat. Oil is also a
            cause for the death of seagrass, which is a staple in the diet of the green turtle. The diets of the
            hawksbill sea turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, and Kemp's ridley sea turtle species have also been affected by
            the oil's role in the reduction of certain sponges and invertebrates. Extended exposure has been found to
            deteriorate the health of a sea turtle in general, making it more weak and vulnerable to a variety of other
            threats.[7]

            According to the Sea Turtle Conservancy, formerly known as the Caribbean Conservation Program, the migration
            habits of sea turtles increase their exposure to marine pollution at each of the stages of their lives
            including eggs, hatchlings, juveniles, sub adults, or nesting adults. In a 1994 study off of Florida's
            Atlantic coast, 63% of hatchlings surveyed were found to have ingested tar. Loggerheads in particular have
            been shown to have the most problems with tarball ingestion, leading to esophageal swelling that can
            dislocate the intestines and liver leading to serious buoyancy issues as well as excessive swelling.[6] Many
            regions heavily associated with oil, either exploration, transportation, or processing, are also significant
            sea turtle environments, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, and particularly the coasts of
            Texas and Florida.[7] Sea turtles existing in the exact areas where oil spills occur are not the only ones
            at risk due to the strong and far reaching ocean currents which can move pollution to great distances from
            its derivation.[8]

            Breeding season is in particular a dangerous time for sea turtles due to the pollution of beach nesting
            sites.[9] Contamination of their diet can lead to disruption of digestion as well as physical injury to the
            sea turtles' digestive tracts. The nesting of female sea turtles is often deterred due to the potential of
            oily effluence.[6] If the female does lay eggs, the development of the eggs is at risk due to either oil in
            the sand or contamination from the mother turtle that was oiled while nesting. If the eggs in the nest have
            contact with oil while in the last half of their incubation phase, the rate of hatchling survival sharply
            decreases and those that do survive have a greater chance of physical deformities.[10]</p>

        <h3>Fishing</h3>
        <p class="p2">According to a study published in Conservation Letters, over 8 million sea turtles died between
            1990 and 2010 due to injuries caused by being accidentally caught by fishing boats.[29] Fisheries often use
            large-scale nets and hook systems that are indiscriminate and catch whatever comes along, be it sea turtle,
            dolphin, or even shark. What is known as "bycatch" is a large contributor to sea turtle deaths, as seen in
            Baja California.[29] Longline, trawl,[30] and gillnet fishing are three types of fishing with the most sea
            turtle accidents. Deaths occur often because of drowning, where the sea turtle was ensnared and could not
            come up for air.[31] Another dangerous aspect of fishing that is common is when sea turtles inadvertently
            swallow sharp hooks, which can get stuck within the soft tissue of the throat and stomach, or damage vital
            organs and intestines.[32]</p>

        <h3>Global Warming</h3>
        <p class="p2">Global warming is estimated to have serious effects on wildlife over the next few decades. There
            is evidence that sea turtles have already been affected. With the increase of temperature, polar ice has
            melted and has led to the rise of sea levels. This rise in sea levels has been a factor in the loss of
            beach, which for sea turtles means less nesting area. Global warming has been associated with severe
            weather, which could mean harsh and numerous storms that erode beaches and flood nests.[35] As the overall
            temperature of the earth rises, so does the temperature of the sand, which diminishes the rate of hatchling
            survival. The temperature of the sand also affects gender, as higher temperatures have been shown to yield
            more female hatchlings. Changes in climate also influence currents and change the number and location of
            prey species. Water that is too warm can also cause coral bleaching, which is detrimental to reefs that are
            essential to certain species, such as the hawksbill sea turtle.[36]</p>
